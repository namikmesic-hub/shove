//! The final offset commit of a stopping Kafka consumer, against librdkafka's
//! mock cluster (`rdkafka::mocking`), which serves the consumer group
//! protocol and offset commits from a localhost listener and needs no Docker.
//!
//! A member that stops issues one synchronous commit for every partition it
//! holds. When the coordinator rejects that commit, or gives no answer within
//! the shutdown deadline, the member ends with `ShoveError::Commit` instead
//! of a clean exit, and a group run counts that under `errors`. These tests
//! inject the rejection and the delay through the mock cluster's
//! `OffsetCommit` handling, which a real broker cannot be asked to do. The
//! error itself is read on the direct consumer, whose `run` returns it; the
//! group run shows the count and the exit code.
//!
//! The topic is bound with `external()`, because the mock broker has no
//! CreateTopics API: each test creates the topic through the mock API, as
//! infra would, and the record is produced with a raw rdkafka producer so it
//! carries a key beside its payload.
//!
//! `test-support` gates the deadline seam this file reads; both Kafka
//! coverage rows enable it, so the suite runs in each.
